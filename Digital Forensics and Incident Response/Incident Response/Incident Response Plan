Objective: Acquire significant experience working with incident response plans, and understand the importance of having a plan that outlines actions to be taken during an incident.
Mission: Practice how to create an incident response plan for an alert.







*Write an incident response plan that includes the first four phases:
• Preparation
• Identification
• Containment
• Eradication

An employee receives a malicious email with malware.
Preparation
- Train employees not to open emails from sources they do not recognize.
- Create a blacklist of malicious senders and block them.
- Create a whitelist of file extensions that are permitted to be received.
Identification
- Create a dashboard that shows the top senders of email to the organization.
- Have employees contact the SOC and inform them about such emails or malware.
- Create alerts of suspicious communication for the C&C.
Containment
- Isolate infected workstations.
- Save event logs.
- Investigate the events and extract IOCs (indicators of compromise).
- Check if other computers received the same message.
- Delete the malicious email from employee inboxes.
Eradication
- If a weakness or vulnerability is discovered, patch it.
- Delete the malware from the computer.
- Restore the system from a backup, if necessary.

A hacker executes a defacement attack on a company's website, whereby the website's contents or appearance is changed.
Preparation
- Create a backup of the website.
- Install WAF/IPS/IDS to identify malicious requests and protect against them.
- Download dedicated tools that monitor changes in web pages.
- Create a dashboard that checks for URL request anomalies.
Identification
- A monitoring tool alerts that a change occurred.
- An employee recognizes a change in the website.
- The dashboard indicates an anomaly in a URL request.
Containment
- Create a blacklist of malicious senders and block them.
- Use logs to identify how the changes were made.
- Route traffic to failover servers or shut down the production server.
- Back up the server for forensic purposes.
Eradication
- Fix the code responsible for the vulnerability.
- Block the IP address that perpetrated the attack.
- Remove the malicious page or script.
