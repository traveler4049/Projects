Created additional file called second_file (opened command with Administrator Priv)
  Ran command C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe > C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\second_file.txt:alt (opened calculator)
  Moved "second_file" to different partitioned drive
Opened FTK Imager to capture image of the drive that "second_file" was moved to (selected image to be physical drive)
