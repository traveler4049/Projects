  Used reverse IP lookup on thehackernews.com (used to identify additional hosted domains on the same name server
  Ran ipconfig /flushdns to clear cache
Opened Microsoft Edge and browsed to yahoo.com
  ipconfig /displaydns > dnscachecontents1.txt (reviewed large amount of DNS cache - data was related to recursive DNS queries, this is gathered when a DNS server queries other DNS servers)

Win+R and searched for regedit
  Navigated to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\Parameters > Right clicked Parameters key to create new value > Added DWORD titled MaxCachedTtl > Value 0
