Objective: Learn how to retrieve information from a raw image file taken from a compromised system
Mission: Invesitage the raw image content using PowerForensics to determine where an attack originated

Resources:
Environment: VirtualBox - Windows10, OSFMount
Files: Windows Dead Analysis OVA


*Investigate to Find the Source of an Attack*
Imported Windows Dead Analysis OVA (Windows10) into VIrtualBox
Opened PowerShell with Administrative privilages
Extracted PowerForensics.zip by using command Install-Module -Name PowerForensics
  Prompted to install NuGet, responded with Y
Entered Get-ForensicAlternateDataSteam to display alternate data stream objects with PowerForensics
Extracted WinServer.zip to desktop
Started OSFMount
  Mounted WinServer.dd in OSFMount to view file. Mount New>Winserver.dd>Mount partitions as virtual disks>Drive emulation:Physical Disk Emulation>Mount.
In Powershell ran command Get-ForensicPartitionTable -Path \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1  
  Ran $mft = Get-ForensicFileRecord -VolumeName \\.\E: (did this to save a list of the image's MFT file records)
Ran $xampp $mft | Where-Object {$_.FullName - like 'E:\xampp\*'} (saving MFT file records that belong to xampp directory to a variable and print its count)

Ran $xampp | Group-Object {$_.FNModifiedTime.ToString('yyyy-MM-dd')} (Grouping files by their modification date and locating the one with the most recent modifications)

Ran $xampp_filtered = $xampp | Where-Object {$_.FNModifiedTime.ToString(‘yyyy-MM-dd’) -eq ‘2015-09-03’} (filtered by most recent modification and saved to new variable)
  Verified the filter with $xampp_filter[0]
  
Ran $xampp_filtered | Select-Object Fullname, FNModifiedTime (used Select-Object function to inspect the files using the two attributes found in previous step)
  Found files appended with .php
  
Ran Get-ForensicContent -Path E:\xampp\mysql\data\dvwa\db.opt (used to get content of the suspicious files (phpshell) and find info on source of attack, Get-ForensicContent and -Path)

.php file revealed IP address and port number from source of attack
