Objective: Understand how to configure a new virtual machine in VirtualBox and how to transfer a file via Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).

Mission: Install the SSH service for remote connection, use Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to transfer files, and work with the Ubuntu Linux distribution. 

• Practical experience with the APT package manager 
• Knowledge of networking configuration 
• Knowledge of SSH commands 


Environment & Tools: Virtualbox - Debian, Ubuntu 20.04, SSH



Part 1:
Installing SSH and working with SSH and SCP
Booted Debian and Ubuntu VM's: configured with Bridged Network Adapter.
  Verified Debiand and Ubuntu VM's received IP addresses by using command 'ip a'
Working with the Debian VM I opened the terminal and switched to root user by entering 'su -'. To make sure I had the most recent files to pull from I entered the 'apt update' command. Since the Debian machine wasn't configured with SSH, I used the command 'apt install ssh -y' to install SSH. I started the SSH service with 'service ssh start, verified SSH was running and active by using 'service ssh status'
  
Part 2:
File creation and transfer between two VM's using SCP
In the Ubuntu VM I opened terminal and used the command 'echo "test text" > testFile. In an attempt to transfer this new file from the Ubuntu VM to the Debian VM I used the command 'scp testFile <user>@<ip address>:~/', entered yes when connection request populated and provided password to Debian machine. On the Debian machine I navigated to the home directory in terminal using 'ls' command. 

The transfer was successful and I was able to view the "testFile"
  
 
 Commands Used:
 
 ip a
