Objective: This lab will expand learnersâ€™ familiarity with network scanning as a means of investigation.
Mission: Use scanning techniques on the network to find the target on the vulnerable machine using Nmap commands. See how scans look on a network analyzer in Wireshark.


Resources:
Environment & Tools: VirtualBox - Kali Linux, Metasploitable, pfSense, Wireshark

*Environment Setup

Using VirtualBox:

File>Import Appliance
  Imported using Advanced Mode
    Selected local file system location and set Mac Address Policy to "Generate New MAC addresses for all network adapters"
    
Powered on pfSense VM
  Started pfSense first since it will be providing DHCP services to the other two VM's in this lab
  Subnet being provided to internal network is 192.168.1.0/24
      Ran into an issue with the IP range since home router was using default 192.168.1.0.
        Through pfSense VM interface, selected option 2 (LAN), changed IP to 10.0.0.1/24
  
  Network Adapter Configurations
    pfSense:
      Adapter 1: Bridged
      Adapter 2: Internal network: PFSense Network
    
    Kali Linux (named kalik):
      Adapter 1: Internal network: PFSense Network
    
    Metasploitable
      Adapater 1: Internal network: PFSense Network
   
   
   Started the kalik and Metasploitable VMs
    Open terminal in kalik and Metasploitable (running command ifconfig) to make sure they were assigned proper IP addresses. Documented the IP's
      From kalik machine, pinged the IP address of Metasploitable VM to verify connectivity between the two machines
      

Using kalik VM (can use -A to pull multiple pieces of information that were individually done in this instance)
  opened terminal to conduct network scan with a ping sweep
    (as root user) nmap -sP 10.0.0.1/24
      was able to locate target
        (as root user) nmap -sS 10.0.0.3
          Noted open ports
            (as root user) nmap -sV 10.0.0.3
              reviewed service/versions
                (as root user) nmap -O 10.0.0.3
                  identified OS
                    (as root user) nmap -p80 10.0.0.3
                    
                      Navigated to /usr/share/nmap/scripts
                        Located ftp-vsftp-backdoor.nse script
                          (as root user in /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory) nmap -script ftp-vsftp-backdoor.nse 10.0.0.3
                          
                          
                          
Opened Wireshark from terminal to monitor network traffic
  Peformed service/version scan with nmap of the Metasploitable machine
    Examined the traffic in Wireshark, narrowed using filter: tcp.flags.syn==1 && ip.src==10.0.0.3
      TCP Flags: [SYN, ACK]
      TCP Ports: Src Port: 53 / Dst Port: 44803
