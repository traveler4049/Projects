Booted up Server1 created in "Server Installation Project" and opened Server Manager>Tools>DNS. Expanded directory tree Server1>Forward Lookup Zones>cyber.local. Selected 'New Host (A or AAAA), assigned name, and IP address. Logged into Windows 10 VM, opened CMD and ran the command 'nslookup test-client.cyber.local. DNS request timed out in 2 seconds and no Alias provide, went back to Server1>Server Manager>Tools>DNS. Expanded directory tree for Server1>Forward Lookup Zones>cyber.local. Selected New Alias (CNAME), assigned alias name, and FQDN for target host as test-client.cyber.local. Switched back to Windows 10 VM and through CMD tool with administrative privileges ran the command 'nslookup my-favorite-client.cyber.local'. Alias is now provided but DNS still times out. Switched over to Server1 and opened Server Manager>DNS>DNS Manager. Expanded directory tree of Server1.cyber.local>Reverse Lookup Zones and selected New Zone. Used the New Zone Wizard and assigned Primary Zone to all DNS servers running on domain controllers in this domain: cyber.local, IPv4 Reverse Lookup Zone, assigned Network ID, and allowed both nonsecure and secure dynamic updates. On the Server Manager>Forward Lookup Zone>cyber.local, opened test-client and selected 'Updated associated poirter (PTR) record'. Switched back to the Windows 10 VM and ran command nslookup (ip address), DNS resolved and provided server name.
